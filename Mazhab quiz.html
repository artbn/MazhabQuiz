<h1 style="text-align:center;">Mazhab Quiz </h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> A quiz that will help you decide on a Mazhab </h2>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;"> We will begin by asking you 10 questions about your beliefs/ideas on different topics
 and then based on your responses we will find the Mazhab that most resembles your beliefs/ideas. 
 The four Mazaheb are Hanafi, Maliki, Hanbali, and Shafiia. Please be warned that although these 
 questions may help you decide on the Mazhab you most closely follow, it is not the final verdict. 
 Instead we urge you to continue learning about all 4 Mazahab and base your decision on that knowledge.
